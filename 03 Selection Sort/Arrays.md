# Arrays
- A collection of memory in consecutive order.
- In an array we can reach to a specific location.
- In Linked List if we want to reach to a specific location we need to triverse whole linked list.
- Adding and removing elements from an array is difficult as compared to Linked List.

## Exercises

### 2.1
If we are performing a lot of insert operations and less read operations then Linked List will be a better option.

### 2.2
The Order Queue is the example of the Linked List. As orders are coming and being added to the end and chef is doing orders from the end so this is perfect example to use Linked List.

### 2.3
As search is performed frequently then it is useful to use array list in this scenario.

### 2.4
As names are being stored in array as in alphabetical order so if the insertion needs to done in array we need to move all elements to one more space ahead. This will take n operations.

### 2.5
For insertion it is better but for searching it can take some time as need to travel first finding the correct postion in array and then linked list.
