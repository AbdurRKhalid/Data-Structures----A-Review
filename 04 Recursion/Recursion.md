# Recursion
- Recursion is calling a function inside itself. The most easier to understand example is finding a key inside a box, but that single box contains a lot of other boxes. So, if key is found we are done otherwise pass another box to function and contiue search.
- While writing a *Recursive Function* we need to write two parts:
    1. Base Case
    2. Recursive Case
- *Recursive Case* is the case when function calls itself.
- *Base Case* is the case when function does not call itself.
