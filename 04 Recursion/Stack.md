# The Stack
- A data structure in which the elements are added on the top and pop from top as well.
- This specific data structure is called *Stack*.
- Computers also use an internal stack called *Call Stack*.
- Whenever a function is called inside an other function, that function gets added on the top of stack.
- When the internal function finishes its calling then we return to the main function in which the other function was called.
- This function is partially complete state as variables are still there before we jump to the second function.
