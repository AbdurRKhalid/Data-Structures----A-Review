# Stack with Recursion
- The stack kept building up until we do not find a proper return value.
- When we will get the return value that return value will be passed down to the next stack function.
- Now this stack function has its own value of arguments as well.
- This argument is the value that is passed to recursive function.

## Exercise
### 3.2
If we write an infinte recursive function the computer will keep running that function until the stack memory is not out. Once the stack memory is out then it will shut down the program or function.
