# Binary Search
- Binary Search is a searching technique in which we search a list by dividing the list in half each time.
- The condition of binary search is that it should be sorted.
- The Time Complexity of binary search is *log_2 (n)*, where `n` is the total number of elements that the array or list contains.

## Exercises
1. Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you are search through it using binary search, what is the maximum number of steps it would take.
*Answer:* This would take log(128) which is 7 steps maximum.

2. Let's say that the size of above list has been doubled i.e. 256, now what is the maximum number of steps that it would take to find an element in this list?
*Answer:* This would take log(256) which is 8 steps maximum.
