# Big O Notation
- Tell us how fast an alogrithm is.
- *Big O notations lets you compare the number of operations*
- It also tells how fast the algorithm grows.
- Big O notation mentions the worst-case scenario.

## Exercises

### 1.3
If I use normal search then Big O for this approach will be O(n). Otherwise, if I use binary search then Big O will be O(log n)

### 1.4
This is a normal O(n) problem because the combinations are infinity and hence needs to check every combination.

### 1.5
This another O(n) problem.

### 1.6
TBC
